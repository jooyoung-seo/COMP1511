An operating system sits between our code and the computer, providing essential services
Terminal (command line driven) allows the sending of simple text commands to our shell
The shell (bash, zsh) is a program that executes commands, and has its own syntax
The shell retunrs output which the terminal can display, or can launch other applications

Commands:
- ls: lists all available directories
- cd: changes directory
- mkdir: creates a directory
- mv [source] [destination]: moves a file from the source to the destination
- cp [source] [destination]: copies a file from the source to the destination
- rm [filename]: removes a file

C:
- a clear language with defined rules, no ambiguity
- many modern programming languages are based on C (e.g. Python)

Compiling and running code:
- VSCode: Ctrl+Alt+N is a shortcut to show output in the terminal
- To actually compile and run the executable:
    1. cd to the directory where the c file is
    2. use: "gcc [filename.c] -o filename" to compile
    3. then: "./filename" to run the program
