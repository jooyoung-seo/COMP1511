An operating system sits between our code and the computer, providing essential services
Terminal (command line driven) allows the sending of simple text commands to our shell
The shell (bash, zsh) is a program that executes commands, and has its own syntax
The shell retunrs output which the terminal can display, or can launch other applications

Commands:
- ls: lists all available directories
- cd: changes directory
- mkdir: creates a directory
- mv [source] [destination]: moves a file from the source to the destination
- cp [source] [destination]: copies a file from the source to the destination
- rm [filename]: removes a file

C:
- a clear language with defined rules, no ambiguity
- many modern programming languages are based on C (e.g. Python)

Compiling and running code:
- VSCode: Ctrl+Alt+N is a shortcut to show output in the terminal
- To actually compile and run the executable:
    1. cd to the directory where the c file is
    2. use: "gcc [filename.c] -o filename" to compile
    3. then: "./filename" to run the program

Data Types:
Each of these have different numbers of bytes that are allocated in memory;
    int: integer, a whole number
    char: a single character
    double: a floating point number (decimal)
- use lowercase letters to start variable names
- use snake_case if multiple words

Integers:
- A whole number (no fractions/decimals)
- Maximum is very large but not infinite (2,147,483,647)

Characters (char):
- A single character in C can also be represented as an int
- The syntax to assign a single character is to put the character in single quotes: 'a'

Double:
- A double-sized floating point number
- A decimal value
